# Aembit Credentials (GitHub Action)

## Overview
This action retrieves temporary credentials from Aembit for use in your GitHub workflows. It enables secure, secretless access to external systems like cloud providers or APIs by dynamically fetching scoped credentials at runtime. This helps improves security within CI/CD pipelines.

## Usage

  with:
    # Aembit Edge SDK Client ID. 
    # The unique identifier for your GitHub Trust Provider in Aembit. 
    # You can find it by logging into your Aembit tenant, navigating to Trust Providers, selecting your GitHub Trust Provider, and copying the Edge SDK Client ID.
